            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Trumpet is an online magazine which recalls     the fashion paper world but also makes your user     able to buy everything he/she sees online in few     seconds. You will focus on the typographic choices   for your logo and pages design and show
		      the creative path that took you to the final version. Youâ€™ll need to explain clearly why you choose to design the pages depending on the different contents of the magazine.</p>

            <h3>The logo</h3>
            <p>What makes a logo feel luxurious ? This was the question that we needed to answer while designing a typographic logo for TheTrumpet. Small caps and heavy tracking was my take on designing this logo.</p>
